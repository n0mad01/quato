Quato twitter MVC framework
===========================
Quato - a twitter MVC framework for managing multiple accounts.

Written somewhere between jan-feb 2011 it unfortunately never came out of a early stage, nevertheless the Authentication/User system & adding/removing multiple Twitter Accounts works well.

Dependencies
===========================

* mongoDB

* for Twitter Services_Twitter (http://pear.php.net/package/Services_Twitter/docs/latest/li_Services_Twitter.html)
