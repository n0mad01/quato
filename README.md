Quato twitter MVC framework
===========================
Quato - a twitter MVC framework for managing multiple accounts using mongoDB, the OAuth communication uses pear's HTTP_OAuth (http://pear.php.net/package/HTTP_OAuth) and for Twitter Services_Twitter (http://pear.php.net/package/Services_Twitter/docs/latest/li_Services_Twitter.html).
For the Layout i used Andy Taylor's 1140 CSS Grid (http://cssgrid.net/).

Written somewhere between jan-feb 2011 it unfortunately never came out of a early stage, nevertheless the Authentication/User system & adding/removing multiple Twitter Accounts works well.
